The miracle of rain

Today, in this sad Sunday evening
it's raining
It rains because we asked for peace in our country
It rains because somehow 
birds have to be brave and go higher
It rains because plants whispered to the wind their need
for touch, for love
for life
and the refresing wind told this to our lovely God
and God, thrilled by those words
cried inconsolably and happily
cried because of his sons on Earth
because it was the only manner that he had
to reach his creatures
to purify them
to let them know he is alive
to liberate them
to clean up all the blood spilled
and so leave the freshness and hope
that a new day will come
and peace will finally flourish.

-Avril Ubau
